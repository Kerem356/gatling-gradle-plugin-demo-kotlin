* sample
https://javadoc.io/doc/io.gatling/gatling-core-java/latest/io/gatling/javaapi/core/Simulation.html[Simulation]
class, demonstrating sufficient Gatling functionality
* proper source file layout

== Create sample project

For this quickstart: `git` must be installed and available in $PATH,
and a JDK must be installed and $JAVA_HOME configured.

[source, bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/gatling/gatling-gradle-plugin-demo-kotlin.git
$ cd ./gatling-gradle-plugin-demo-kotlin
----

== Run simulations

To test it out, use the following commands:

* Run all Gatling simulations at once

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew gatlingRun
----

* Run a single simulation by its FQN (fully qualified class name)

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew gatlingRun-computerdatabase.BasicSimulation
----

== Use with Gatling Enterprise Cloud

To package your simulation for https://gatling.io/enterprise/[Gatling Enterprise Cloud], run:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew gatlingEnterprisePackage
----

Check out https://gatling.io/docs/enterprise/cloud/reference/user/package_gen/#gradle-project[the documentation] for
